## Profile
Currently, I am working as a PostDoc at ASRI (Automation and Systems Research Institute) as part of **my alternative military service as a technical research personnel** with <a href="https://larr.snu.ac.kr/" target="_blank">LARR (Laboratory for Autonomous Robotics Research)</a>.  

My research interests lie in the **reinforcement learning-based policy, path planner, controller, and hybrid stability analysis of aerial manipulation systemsms**.

The main results of my research are shown below, and please refer to my [**CV**](https://jh-byun.github.io/download/CV_2026_02_13.pdf) and [**research statement**](https://jh-byun.github.io/download/research_statement/Research_Statement_251112.pdf) for more information.

## Recent Updates

**January 2026**: I was selected as the principal candidate of the [Fulbright Postdoctoral Fellowship Program](https://www.fulbright.or.kr/grant/postdoc/) and appointed as a visiting scholar in [Vijay Kumar Lab](https://www.kumarrobotics.org/) at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, USA. The visiting period is from August 1st, 2026 to July 31st, 2027.

**November 2025**: I gave a seminar as an invited speaker at the Sookmyeong Woman's University in Seoul, Korea.

**October 2025**: I gave a talk named "Aerial physical interaction strategy considering changes in dynamics" as an invited speaker at the [Workshop on Advanced Aerial Aobotics](http://www.dragon.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/all-events/workshop-aar-2025/) held in Tokyo, Japan.

## Always Open to Work!
If you are interested in **fully autonomous aerial manipulation**, you can look around our publications and open projects to find an inspiration. Also, **you can also contact me** using various ways, such as e-mail, facebook, instagram, etc., to discuss the relevant topics.

## Purpose of Posting
As a postdoctoral researcher, I am going to share our publications on <a href="https://jh-byun.github.io/_pages/pub/index.html">PUBLICATIONS</a> tab whenever our team publish a paper to conferences or journals and our team's open projects on <a href="https://jh-byun.github.io/_pages/pub/index.html">STUDY</a> tab. Not only that, my daily life will be posted on <a href="https://jh-byun.github.io/_pages/blog/index.html">BLOG</a> tab. I also want you to enjoy the photos which are uploaded on the <a href="https://jh-byun.github.io/_pages/photography/index.html">PHOTOGRAPHY</a> tab. Please feel free to visit my website!
