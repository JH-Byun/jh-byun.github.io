## Profile
**I'm actively seeking a PostDoc position abroad, starting in March 2026, in the field of robotics and drone engineering.** Currently, I am working as a PostDoc at ASRI (Automation and Systems Research Institute) as part of **my alternative military service as a technical research personnel** with <a href="https://larr.snu.ac.kr/" target="_blank">LARR (Laboratory for Autonomous Robotics Research)</a>.

**Research statement** can be found <a href="https://jh-byun.github.io/download/research_statement/Research_Statement_250721.pdf">here</a>.

## Recent Updates

#### May 2025
I orally presented my conference proceeding on "Safety-critical control for aerial physical interaction in uncertain environment"[<a href="https://jh-byun.github.io/pub/ICRA25/">3</a>] at ICRA 2025 held in Atlanta, USA. 

#### October 2024
I orally presented my RA-L work on "Image-based time-varying contact force control of aerial manipulator using robust impedance filter"[<a href="https://jh-byun.github.io/pub/RAL24/">2</a>] at IROS 2024 held in أَبُو ظَبِي (Abu Dhabi), UAE. 

#### June 2024
I orally presented my work on haptic-based bilateral teleoperation of an aerial manipulator for extracting a wedged object with the compensation of human reaction time [<a href="https://jh-byun.github.io/pub/ICUAS24/">1</a>] at ICUAS 2024 held in Χανιά (Chania), Crete, Greece.

## Purpose of Posting
As a PostDoc research, I am going to share our publications on <a href="https://jh-byun.github.io/_pages/pub/index.html">PUBLICATIONS</a> tab whenever our team publish a paper to conferences or journals and our team's open projects on <a href="https://jh-byun.github.io/_pages/pub/index.html">STUDY</a> tab. Not only that, my daily life will be posted on <a href="https://jh-byun.github.io/_pages/blog/index.html">BLOG</a> tab and <a href="https://jh-byun.github.io/_pages/photography/index.html">PHOTOGRAPHY</a> tab to share my personal life, too.

## Will it be helpful for you?
If you are interested in the design of stable and safe operation strategy for aerial physical interaction based on the concept of hybrid dynamical systems, you can look around our publications and open projects to find an inspiration. Also, you can also contact me using various ways, such as e-mail, facebook, instagram, etc., to discuss the relevant topics.

In addition, I also want you to enjoy the photos which are uploaded on the <a href="https://jh-byun.github.io/_pages/photography/index.html">PHOTOGRAPHY</a> tab. Please feel free to visit my website!
