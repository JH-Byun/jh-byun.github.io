## Profile
**I'm actively seeking a PostDoc position abroad, starting in March 2026, in the field of robotics and drone engineering.** Currently, I am working as a PostDoc at ASRI (Automation and Systems Research Institute) as part of **my alternative military service as a technical research personnel** with <a href="https://larr.snu.ac.kr/" target="_blank">LARR (Laboratory for Autonomous Robotics Research)</a>.

**Research statement** can be found <a href="https://jh-byun.github.io/download/research_statement/Research_Statement_250721.pdf">here</a>.

## Recent Updates

**May 2025:** I orally presented my conference proceeding on "Safety-critical control for aerial physical interaction in uncertain environment"[<a href="https://jh-byun.github.io/pub/ICRA25/">3</a>] at ICRA 2025 held in Atlanta, USA. 

**October 2024:** I orally presented my RA-L work on "Image-based time-varying contact force control of aerial manipulator using robust impedance filter"[<a href="https://jh-byun.github.io/pub/RAL24/">2</a>] at IROS 2024 held in أَبُو ظَبِي (Abu Dhabi), UAE. 

**June 2024:** I orally presented my work on haptic-based bilateral teleoperation of an aerial manipulator for extracting a wedged object with the compensation of human reaction time [<a href="https://jh-byun.github.io/pub/ICUAS24/">1</a>] at ICUAS 2024 held in Χανιά (Chania), Crete, Greece.

## Always Open to Work!
If you are interested in **fully autonomous aerial manipulation**, you can look around our publications and open projects to find an inspiration. Also, **you can also contact me** using various ways, such as e-mail, facebook, instagram, etc., to discuss the relevant topics.

## Purpose of Posting
As a postdoctoral researcher, I am going to share our publications on <a href="https://jh-byun.github.io/_pages/pub/index.html">PUBLICATIONS</a> tab whenever our team publish a paper to conferences or journals and our team's open projects on <a href="https://jh-byun.github.io/_pages/pub/index.html">STUDY</a> tab. Not only that, my daily life will be posted on <a href="https://jh-byun.github.io/_pages/blog/index.html">BLOG</a> tab. I also want you to enjoy the photos which are uploaded on the <a href="https://jh-byun.github.io/_pages/photography/index.html">PHOTOGRAPHY</a> tab. Please feel free to visit my website!
