## Profile
**I'm actively seeking a PostDoc position abroad, starting in March 2026, in the field of robotics and drone engineering.** Currently, I am working as a PostDoc at ASRI (Automation and Systems Research Institute) as part of **my alternative military service as a technical research personnel** with <a href="https://larr.snu.ac.kr/" target="_blank">LARR (Laboratory for Autonomous Robotics Research)</a>. 

**The main results of my research** are shown below, and please refer to my [**CV**](https://jh-byun.github.io/download/CV_2025_08_12.pdf) and [**research statement**](https://jh-byun.github.io/download/research_statement/Research_Statement_250805.pdf) for more information.

## Recent Updates

**May 2025:** I orally presented my conference proceeding on "Safety-critical control for aerial physical interaction in uncertain environment" at ICRA 2025 held in Atlanta, USA. 

**February 2025:**  I have earned my Ph.D. from the Department of Aerospace Engineering, Seoul National University College of Engineering under the guidance of my advisor, H. Jin Kim, with a dissertation titled "Aerial Physical Interaction Strategy Considering Changes in Dynamics".

**October 2024:** I orally presented my RA-L work on "Image-based time-varying contact force control of aerial manipulator using robust impedance filter" at IROS 2024 held in أَبُو ظَبِي (Abu Dhabi), UAE. 

## Always Open to Work!
If you are interested in **fully autonomous aerial manipulation**, you can look around our publications and open projects to find an inspiration. Also, **you can also contact me** using various ways, such as e-mail, facebook, instagram, etc., to discuss the relevant topics.

## Purpose of Posting
As a postdoctoral researcher, I am going to share our publications on <a href="https://jh-byun.github.io/_pages/pub/index.html">PUBLICATIONS</a> tab whenever our team publish a paper to conferences or journals and our team's open projects on <a href="https://jh-byun.github.io/_pages/pub/index.html">STUDY</a> tab. Not only that, my daily life will be posted on <a href="https://jh-byun.github.io/_pages/blog/index.html">BLOG</a> tab. I also want you to enjoy the photos which are uploaded on the <a href="https://jh-byun.github.io/_pages/photography/index.html">PHOTOGRAPHY</a> tab. Please feel free to visit my website!
